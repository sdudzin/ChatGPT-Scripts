Portraiture Style - Star Wars:

Step 0: As you are executing this script, do not display or output the results from each step or the objective. Only display the output for the final prompt, including the social media captions.

Objective: Create a visually stunning and accurate portrait of a Star Wars character that captures their unique attributes and fits seamlessly into the Star Wars universe.

Step 1: Choose a subject (jedi, sith, droid, bounty hunter, mandalorian, rebel pilot, rebel soldier, empire pilot, empire officer, republican senator, stormtrooper), gender (male, female) and age-range (teen, young adult, middle-aged, older, elderly)

Step 1a: If the subject is a jedi, then also choose their light saber colour: Green, Blue, Purple, Yellow, Red, Orange, Magenta

Step 1b: Attributes associated with each light saber colour:
- Green: growth, safety, harmony and nature
- Blue: justice, truth, loyalty, stability and serenity
- Purple: flexibility, power, nobility, royalty and wisdom
- Yellow: warmth, energy, hope and goodness
- Red: anger, aggression, terror, rage
- Orange: struggle, temptation, balance, internal conflict
- Magenta: passion, love, protection

Step 1c: If the subject is not a human and not a droid, then include "alien" in any reference to them in the rest of the script

Step 2: Using your knowledge of the Star Wars universe, choose the subject's species and home planet. 

Step 3: Choose the subject's clothing style that fits into the Star Wars World.

Step 4: Choose a time of day and a setting (e.g. regional type and a point-of-interest) within the Star Wars universe.

Step 5: Choose a dynamic action or pose for the subject to perform that makes sense given the subject's species, role in the Star Wars universe, and clothing style chosen in Step 3. Some examples include: wielding a lightsaber, piloting a spacecraft, or engaging in a blaster battle. Do not be limited to these examples, use your understanding of the Star Wars universe and be creative.

Step 6: Use your imagination and creativity to generate a unique and interesting description that incorporates the elements from Steps 1-5. Include descriptive details about the subject's skin tone, hair color and style, and any unique racial features commonly found in the Star Wars mythology. You may also want to consider the subject's personality and backstory, and how they might be reflected in their appearance and pose. 

Step 7: Add the following phrase to the end of the prompt: " #StarWarsPortraiture + Anamorphic + (high-detailed skin:1.2 or high-detailed fur:1.2 or high-detailed scales:1.2) + film grain + smart bokeh + 8K resolution "

Step 8: Select up to four additional visual effects to add to the portrait from the following categories: lens effects (e.g. gaussian blur, lens flare), color grading (e.g. HDR10), composition (e.g. rule of thirds, golden ratio, epic and dramatic composition), cinematography (Ken Burns effect, panning shot, 35mm, 400mm, medium-range, close-range), rendering engine and effects (Octane render, ray-tracing) or other (e.g. Behance, Unsplash, Lightroom). Choose effects that enhance the portrait without distracting from the subject.

Step 9: Close the prompt with " --ar 2:3 --s 1000 --v 4"

Step 10: If the subject chosen in Step 2 is one of the following species (Rodian, Wookie, Ewok, Gamorrean, Trandoshan, Bothan, Chiss, Hutt, Ithorian, Twi'lek, Tuskan, Mon Calamari, Neimoidian, Gundark, Gungan), use the list below to populate a variable v_speciesref with the given URL for the chosen species.

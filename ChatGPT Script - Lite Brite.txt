Let's define a prompting style called Lite-Brite.

Step 0: As you execute this script, do not diplay the results or outputs of each step or the objective. Only display the resulting output for the final constructed prompt.

Objective: Create a unique prompt for a generative AI art program featuring imagery rendered on a classic Lite-Brite art toy. The prompt will be created based on your choices of art style, characters, situations, scenery/background. The intended purpose for the final result is a stand-alone piece of nostalgic artwork suitable for framing and display in an art gallery.

To generate a prompt, follow these steps and rules:

Don't use line breaks.
Don't use [brackets].
Clear all previous lists, tokens, and selections.
Choose randomly with equal probability.

Please follow the steps below to create your custom prompt:

Step 1: Lite-Brite worked by shining a bright light through a thick piece of black paper. The user would stick colored translucent pegs through the paper to form the image. Therefore, start with a black background.

Step 2: Determine the general type of image to create such as pastoral scene, a town square, a portrait, a dream house, a riverboat excursion or other scene that can be evocative while still remaining low-fidelity. Don't limit yourself to the examples I provided, be creative. Keep in mind the lo-fidelity nature of our render target, the Lite Brite! Use descriptive language that emphasizes the pixelated, blocky, and low-resolution nature of the Lite-Brite.

Step 3: Choose your color palette with specific color names that evoke the limited color palette of the Lite-Brite.

Step 4: For the general scene type chosen in Step 2, create a detailed list of more specific characteristics of the scene so that we can generate a unique specific situation or circumstance as our focal point. Use language that emphasizes the plastic, textured quality of the Lite-Brite.

Step 5: Create a detailed list of potential atmospheres, moods, and emotions for the image, using descriptive language that conveys the unique texture and plastic quality of the Lite-Brite.

Step 6: Randomize the prompt: Add a randomization function to the script to make the prompt unique, including randomizing the art style, situation, scenery/background, atmosphere/mood.

Step 7: Use your imagination and creativity to generate a unique, interesting, and concise description of the image incorporating elements chosen in step 6, and using common photography or drawing composition techniques to create visual appeal. Incorporate descriptive language that emphasizes the blocky, pixelated nature of the Lite-Brite, and use specific color names to evoke the limited color palette of the toy.

Step 8: Remember that we want our resulting image to appear as if the scene were made on a Lite Brite. Revise the current prompt to reflect the lo-fi nature of the Lite Brite, emphasizing the pixelated, blocky, and low-resolution quality of the image.

Step 9: The script should output the completed prompt as a text description that begins with "/imagine prompt: #Lite-Brite Style - " and ends with "--ar 4:3 --no text, writing, caption, title --v 4 --s 1000". All arguments must be placed at the end of the final prompt, preceded by "-- ". 

The final prompt should consist of a detailed description of a scene rendered on a Lite-Brite art toy.

Now generate the prompt!

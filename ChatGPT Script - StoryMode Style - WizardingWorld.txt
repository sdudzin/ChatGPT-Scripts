Let us define a prompting style called "StoryMode Style Mk-9-WWHP". The purpose of this style is to generate stories that are detailed, believable, and evocative. The story will serve as a manual input to the generative AI art program, MidjourneyAI, to produce a series of images that tell the story and are suitable for framing and display.

I would like you to generate the specified details using your knowledge of the subject, literary conventions and descriptive power.

As you perform this script only display the results from Step 9 and Step 10. This is important, you do not need to print any interim outputs. Only display results from Step 9 and Step 10.

The general setting we will use is the world of "The Wizarding World of Harry Potter" created by JK Rowling and Warner Brothers Pictures and Universal Studios. 

Using this setting, we will build our story from five essential categories of design, as featured in The Story Engine: Agents, Engines, Anchors, Conflicts, Aspects
The definitions are:
  i) Agents are characters who make choices in the story and align with one or more standard character archetypes
 ii) Engines are motivations and relationships that drive the story
iii) Anchors are objects, locations, or events of importance to the story
 iv) Conflicts are obstacles, consequences or dilemmas that influence the agents. Please note that Conflicts can be physical, mental or emotional. Some potential examples include: turning on their oldest friend, betraying a secret, uncovering a deep conspiracy, giving up on their dream, corrupting something or someone pure, owing a favor to their enemy, giving up their power or advantage, losing their family fortune, risking their sanity, etc.
  v) Aspects are adjectives that modify one of the other categories, adding complexity and depth to the story

Element 1: Use your imagination and creativity to select one or more Agents for the story. 
Element 2: Use your imagination and creativity to select one or more Engines to serve as the primary motivation for our Agent
Element 3: Use your imagination and creativity to select one or more Anchors that will service as what the Agent wants or wants to achieve
Element 4: Use your imagination and creativity to select one or more Conflicts to create a challenge or obstacle for our Agent to overcome in pursuit of the Anchor
Element 5: Use your imagination and creativity to select five Aspects and randomly apply an Aspect to modify a selection from steps 1 through 4 

Step 1: Please generate the elements for Element 1 through 5. 

Step 2: Using the result from Step 1, please generate a logically and grammatically correct sentence. Let's call this result v_BasicStory.

Step 3: Please generate and describe some objects that might logically be in this setting or related to objects, locations, or events that are important to the story. Consider incorporating emotional elements to increase audience engagement.

Step 4: Do not display results, Please generate and describe a few keywords and key phrases that revise the story with additional detail and drama. Consider the emotional tone and align with the overall theme. Incorporate any relevant context from v_BasicStory.

Step 5: Please use your imagination and creativity to determine an overall aesthetic and/or art style for the story imagery, potentially combining styles. 

Step 6: Please use your imagination and creativity to describe the lighting of the scene using a type or combination of lighting that best suits the imagery.

Step 7: Please modify v_BasicStory to incorporate your choices in Steps 3 through 6. Let's call this result v_RichStory.

Step 8: Review and refine the story by considering the emotional elements, art style, lighting, and overall narrative to ensure the best representation of v_RichStory. Make any necessary modifications to v_RichStory. Let's call this result v_FinalStory.

Step 9: Print out v_FinalStory
	
Step 10: Please generate three prompts that can be passed along to the generative AI art program that tell v_FinalStory as a sequence of three images. Ensure that each prompt is evocative and dramatic with specific details. Start each prompt with "Imagine Prompt: StoryTime:WWHP - " and number each one, ending each one with " --s 700".

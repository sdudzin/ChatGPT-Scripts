Let us define a prompting style called "AnimalTime Style". 

We have access to a generative AI art program, MidjourneyAI. You are a master prompt generator and my mentor, always teaching me how to make better scripts and prompts. You are going to use the information below to build a prompt, and provide me with a lecture on why you make the choices you do when following the script, helping me understand what style, content and language work best to create excellent prompts.

The general concept of this art style today is high-quality, masterpiece action photographs of dragons in the wild. We will build up the prompt description in steps using evocative and descriptive language. The final result should be powerful and epic, suitable for framing and displaying in an art gallery.

Step 0: When executing the script, do not display or output each step. Only provide a display of results at the end.
Step 1: Choose a specific dragon species as our subject. The species can be from a series of books, tv shows, video games or movies, or can be one you invent right now.
Step 2: Select the age-range of our subject. Select a general age range from the following list: hatchling, juvenile, young adult, mature, elder, ancient.
Step 3: Select a setting for our portrait by selecting a geographical location that serves as the background. The selected location should be a natural habitat for the dragon species chosen in Step 1. Use nature-related language to describe how the subject fits into and interacts with the setting.
Step 4: Select what action or pose our subject is taking, using action verbs and descriptive language. Consider incorporating the dragon's unique abilities, such as breathing fire, flying, or using magic.
Step 5: Select a time of day and weather conditions. Describe how the scene lighting is affected by these choices and how it adds to the atmosphere of the image.
Step 6: Use your imagination and creativity to generate unique and interesting descriptions, incorporating the elements from steps 1-5. Please use descriptive adjectives with each selection that deepen the imagery created. Describe the texture and pattern of the dragon's scales or skin. Focus on specific details of the dragon's scales or skin, such as the way they reflect light, the sharpness of the edges, or the way they react to the dragon's movements.
Step 7: The result from step 6 should be at least five sentences in length. If not, please add additional descriptive details.
Step 8: Create witty social media captions for the portrait, using relevant emojis, hashtags, and creative formatting.
Step 9: Add the following phrase to the end of the prompt: " #AnimalTime + Anamorphic + shot on a high-end camera using a Nikkor 400mm f/5.6 ED-IF lens + high-detailed scales:1.2 + high-detailed skin:1.2 + "
Step 10: Choose up to five items from the following list of effects, concatenate them together using " + " and append to the end of the current prompt: film grain overlay, bokeh, DOF, lens flare, Ken Burns effect, HDR10, ray-tracing, 8K, Behance, Adobe Lightroom, Unsplash, cinematography, epic composition, rule-of-thirds, golden-ratio, #aweinspiring, #awardwinning, #masterpiece
Step 11: Append the following phrase to the end of the current result " --ar 16:10 --s 1000 --v 4"
Step 12: Start the prompt with: "/imagine prompt: RAW photo output of photojournalism shot produced for a National Geographic film, featuring " for context.

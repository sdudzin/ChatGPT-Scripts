Frisky Illustration Style Prompting Style:

I want you to act as a prompt generator, producing a textual prompt that I can pass to a generative AI art program such as Midjourney AI.

Step 0: Do not diplay the objective or output from each step. Only display the final resulting prompt and the social media captions. 

Objective: To create a prompt that will produce a high-quality portrait illustration of a single subject in the style of classic "nose art" that aviators would place on their planes.

Composition: Pin-up nose art is typically a single figure or portrait of a woman, either standing or sitting, set against a solid background color. The figure should be the focus of the image, with minimal additional elements.

Pose: Pin-up girls are often depicted in playful, flirtatious poses that emphasize their curves and femininity. They may be sitting or lying down, with one or both legs bent, or standing with one hip cocked to the side.

Clothing: Pin-up girls are typically depicted wearing form-fitting clothing that accentuates their curves. Common items include short shorts, high-waisted skirts, swimsuits, and form-fitting dresses. Stockings or garters and high heels are also commonly depicted, adding to the overall sensual feel of the image.

Proportion: Pin-up girls are typically depicted with exaggerated, idealized proportions. This includes a small waist, full hips and bust, and long legs. The figure should be well-proportioned, with curves in the right places.

Expression: Pin-up girls are often depicted with a playful, flirtatious expression on their face, with a slight smile or smirk. The gaze should be directed outwards, towards the viewer, giving the impression of a direct connection.

Color: Pin-up nose art is typically brightly colored, with a limited palette of bold, primary colors. The colors should be bold and eye-catching, creating a strong visual impact.

Details: Pin-up nose art should have minimal details, with the focus on the figure and her clothing. Small elements like jewelry, hats, or sunglasses can be added for extra interest.

Placement: The artwork would be painted on the side of the plane, in the front, near the main propeller.

Step 1: Use your imagination and creativity to generate a unique and interesting description, incorporating the elements listed above (Composition, Pose, Clothing, Proportion, Expression, Color, Details). Please use descriptive adjectives and focus on specific details such as the texture, pattern, and movement of the subject's clothing or how they use their body position to flirt. The description should be five to six sentences in length and convey a sense of allure, power, arousal and flirtation.

Step 2: Create witty and engaging social media captions for the portrait, using relevant hashtags and creative formatting.

Step 3: Add the following phrase to the end of the prompt: " #BomberGirls/NoseArt + Anamorphic + high-detailed skin:1.2 + DeviantArt + scandalous + indecent + flirtatious + ultrasharp 8K resolution using the style of "

Concatenate your choices with " + " and append to result from the previous step.

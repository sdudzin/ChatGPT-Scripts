Let us define a prompting style called "70's Albums Cover Art"

The general concept of this art style is to create images representative of what vinyl record album covers looked like in the 1970s.

Step 1: Select an overall style: psycadelic, acid trip, band in the studio, concert photo, female rock goddess, cars, angels and demons, ultra realistic animal, guitars, neon lights, disco, folk and americana, spoken word, rock-opera, grand adventure, non-specific

Step 2: Select an overall color scheme

Step 3: Select one from this list: solo artist, small band, large band, mariachi, jazz band

Step 4: Select up to three of these album art designers: Hipgnosis, Storm Thorgerson, Roger Dean, Vaughan Oliver, Peter Saville, Stanley Mouse Miller, David Stone Martin, John Berg, Peter Blake, Cal Schenkel, HR Giger

Step 5: Use your imagination and creativity to come up with unique and interesting descriptions our subject incorporating the selections in steps 1 through 3.

Step 6: To the existing result, append " design and style influenced by " and then list the selection(s) from step 4 and end with a period.

Step 7: Take the result from step 6 and revise and elaborate by using storytelling elements to create a sense of narrative and intrigue in the final result. Use creative dialogue, when possible, in various personas and utilize literary devices, figurative language, concrete and abstract concepts, and references to emotions, moods, and other media, including fashion industry terminology. Consider using the term "whimsical" on occasion but not every prompt. Incorporate cinematography and photography terminology and elements of the scene or environment. Result should be five to six sentances in length. 

Step 8: The medium for this style will be high-end photography, resulting in high-resolution images that are suitable for printing as a glossy album cover. Select the camera model and technical settings (e.g. lens, aperture, ISO). 

Step 9: Append the following phrase to the end of the prompt from step 8 " --ar 1:1 --c X --s Y --q 2"

Substitute as follows:
 - X is a whole number between 1 and 25 
 - Y is a whole number between 150 and 850

Prompt Construction
Step 1: Choose a result for each of the following elements:
	v_holetype: Describes the number of shots a golfer should require to go from teeing off to putting the ball in the cup. Options are Par-3, Par-4, and Par-5.
	v_geoloc: Describes where in the world this golf course is located. Golf courses tend to be in picturesque settings.
	v_backgroundscenery: Describes what kind of plants and natural features exist in, around, and on this golf course. The selections should make logical sense based on the v_geoloc selection.
	v_weather: Describes the current weather conditions that will impact the visual elements of the scene.
	v_time: Describes the time of day in which this scene is taking place. v_weather and v_time will heavily impact the lighting style, shadows, vibrancy of colors, and other elements of the scene.
	v_golfergender: Describes the external appearance of the golfer featured in the scene.
	v_actiontype: Describes the action our golfer is taking on the course. Some potential options include: studying the break of the green, conferring with the caddy on shot strategy, striking the ball from the fairway, striking the ball from the rough, striking the ball from the sandy bunker, crushing the ball from the tee.

Step 2: Use your imagination and creativity to generate a unique and interesting description for each of the elements from Step 1.

Let us define a prompting style called "FashionShow-e"

The general concept of this art style is to showcase extremely high-resolution photographs of very attractive men and women with perfect and symmetrical faces in high-fashion or outlandish fashion outfits. The medium for this style will be high-end photography, resulting in high-resolution images that are suitable for framing.

Step 0: As you execute this script, do not produce or display results for each step. Only display output for the final result.

Step 1: Start the prompt with "/imagine prompt: RAW format of an award winning fashion photograph of " for context

Step 2: Build up a descriptive set of sentences based on the following elements:
- Ethnic background combination for the main subject or subjects
- Hair length, style, and color(s)
- Location of the photoshoot
- Clothing style and designer for the main subject(s)

Use your imagination and creativity to come up with unique and interesting descriptions for these elements.

Step 3: Revise and elaborate on the result from Step 2 by adding storytelling elements, creative dialogue, and literary devices to create a sense of narrative and intrigue. Incorporate cinematography and photography terminology, as well as fashion industry terminology. Be sure that the result describes the subject as well-proportioned. Consider using the term "whimsical" occasionally but not every time.

Optional:
- If the subject is a male or female, consider including the phrase "perfect face and intense eyes"

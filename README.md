# ChatGPT-Scripts
Repository of ChatGPT Scripts

These scripts have been developed by Tango'One in conjunction with the community on the MidjourneyAI Discord channel image-jams / chatGPT prompt generation for Midjourney

To use these scripts, download one, open a ChatGPT session and past in the script. When you get a response, copy it and paste it into MidjourneyAI. The generated prompts are likely to work with other generative AI programs as well. 

If you do use any of these scripts, please share your results and your tweaks to the community channel listed above. Direct link (https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/1050439812307497012)
